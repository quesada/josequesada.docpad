                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>How-to-blog-data-driven-to-maximize-impact,-using-competitors&#39;-social-data-and-special-google-searches</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you have thought a lot about getting traffic from google searches by writing content. This is content marketing the safest way (for now) to acquire links. Google employs PhDs to prevent most SEO tricks, and because of that SEO best practices change from time to time. But focusing on excellent content is a safe bet, since most other methods have a high risk of being detected algorithmically. </p>
<p>The way I see it, there are two problems you need to solve: (1) how to find good topics that your audience craves, and (2) how to get others to link to you. Let&#39;s try to answer these questions with data, as it should be :).</p>
<p>What comes next is a how-to to blog in a data-driven way. The hacks may seem too simple to actually work, even naive. But applying these systematically will get you results; and results you can measure. Try them for a week, and compare it with your previous blogging routine. This stuff relies on (1) collecting data from content nearby that is liked, so you can write similar posts, and (2) special google searches to get links.</p>
<p>There are many blog posts on <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/12/10/you-need-a-blog-strategy/">blogging strategy</a>. But I haven&#39;t found actionable advice that is data-driven on a single post. Here is my attempt to write such a post for you.</p>
<h2>What to write</h2>
<h3>The effect table</h3>
<p>If you are a stand-up comedian, you get immediate feedback as you perform. This helps you morph your story on the fly, do more of what works. But since there&#39;s no record of what people laughed at in the last 6 months... your guesses are limited to the time slice they are looking at you on stage. The more data you have, the better your guesses will be. As a blogger, you have an even better superpower: you can tap into what your audience likes not only when you write, but when others write. And then use this information to target exactly what your audience likes like a heat-seeking missile. I&#39;ll show you how.</p>
<p>We are going to create a table that gives you clarity that few bloggers have (unless they possess super-human intuition). We will use it to make decisions for all the key questions on the rest of the post.</p>
<p>(Credit: I got this idea from Neil Patel&#39;s mailing list, but I have added my own twist).</p>
<p><strong>I call this the &#39;effect table&#39;</strong>. Let&#39;s put in it anything that answers the question: &#39;are my efforts having the effect I want, and if so, how much?&#39;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create an spreadsheet that lists all your competing blogs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For each post, you want to get an idea about how much their readership liked the content. Nothing better than counting tweets, facebook likes and all the obvious social submissions. You can automate this by using <a href="http://sharedcount.com/">sharedcount</a>. Take the url and paste it in the textbox. Since you want to do this for multiple urls, you could use their &#39;multi-url dashboard&#39;.  The last time I tried, the table didn&#39;t render on chrome 25; it does work on firefox, but the rendering is sloppy (headers are to the right of the table, columns are not aligned. It doesn&#39;t matter, because what you need is the &#39;export to CSV&#39; function, and this works great. You will get something like the table below. I used two random posts; you should use the most recent posts from your competitors, or pundits you follow in your field.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This technique will show you clearly which topics will get your audience engaged. You can write content related to those topics and they&#39;ll  likely outperform topics that you generate &#39;by hunch&#39;. It&#39;s kind of scary how most bloggers, your competitors included, will be just be following &#39;what they personally like&#39; as a compass for writing. While the human brain is pretty good at detecting trends, it&#39;s never a bad idea to supplement its capacity with hard numbers. This is the power of a data-driven blogging strategy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following what the data tells us also increases our chances of writing a big hit. And it works wonders for writer&#39;s block.</p>
 <table class="pretty-table" summary="Social media data for two random posts.">

<tr><th scope="col">URL</th><th scope="col">FB Likes</th><th scope="col">FB Shares</th><th scope="col">FB Comments</th><th scope="col">FB Total</th><th scope="col">Tweets</th><th scope="col">+1s</th><th scope="col">Diggs</th><th scope="col">Pins</th><th scope="col">LinkedIn Shares</th></tr>

<tr><th scope="row"><a href="http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2013/03/25/robert-wilensky-dies-at-61/"> Wilensky dies at 61</a></th><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>48</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

<tr><th scope="row"><a href="http://irce.internetretailer.com/2013/"> Iretailer conf</a></th><td>62</td><td>12</td><td>7</td><td>81</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr>
</table>

<p><br></p>
<p>Some other data you can add is &#39;number of comments&#39; on the post, and &#39;Hacker news votes&#39; if the story was submitted to hacker news.  </p>
<p>One small detail: bear in mind that post date matters.</p>
<p>The date is often in the url, so no need to add a different column. Comparing a 3yo post with one out for a day is wrong because the older post has had more time to collect mentions and likes. This is even more of an issue for evergreen content. However, for normal, newsy stuff, after a week of social media swirl counts are stable.</p>
<h3>Should you stay on topic, blogging only relevant stuff for your audience?</h3>
<p>When blogging, do you need laser focus on your audience&#39;s pain points? i.e., are detours damaging? Is every blog post that fails to hit their pain deducting from your perceived expertise?</p>
<p>This is a question I struggle with myself. Most of the posts I&#39;d like to write are highly technical. To date I have not attempted to write posts with formulas, or complex graphs, because they do not work as well as more &#39;marketer friendly&#39; posts (I learnt this by using the effect table).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have data, but every time a member of your audience checks his mail or rss reader, to find a post that has NOTHING to do with his problems or one too advanced for his level, you are in danger of losing him. Although a sparkling of tangential posts is ok, be careful. Survey your audience, they might tell you when you were blogging something they didn&#39;t care about. And of course, look at your engagement data. Are they commenting? Retweeting? Each audience is different, though. You can test yours, with the effect table.</p>
<p>But what do you do with those posts you have in your scratch box that are great, but not super-targeted for your audience? I recommend to post them in social media sites. I&#39;m covering this next.</p>
<h3>How long?</h3>
<p>How long should a post be? Above 2000 words gets the best google rankings, and the most backlinks.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/">serpIQ</a> blog analyzed the top 10 search results for over 20,000 keywords and noticed a pattern.</p>
<p>The average content length for a web page that ranks in the top 10 results for any keyword on Google has at least 2000 words. And the higher up you go on the search listings page, the more content each web page contains.</p>
<p><img src="/images/optimal-post-length.jpg" alt="picture alt" title="Optimal post length">   </p>
<h2>Where to write</h2>
<h3>Should you post on your own blog, or do a guest post?</h3>
<p>Guest posting involves writing an article and publishing it on a web site owned by another publisher. They get a free article and you get a free link. Unfortunately, this technique is very close to paying for links -a very large violation of the Google Webmaster Guidelines. You aren’t paying for links with cash, but you are effectively paying for links with writing work. However, this is still in the spirit of what google stands for: making a better web. So I think guest posting is safe, and will be in the near future.</p>
<p>By making strategic partnerships with other bloggers, you can produce content and put it in a great location. But how well does it work?</p>
<p>You can check: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Audience match. How well does the audience of the other site match your audience or the audience you hope to build?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Site popularity. How large an audience does the other site have? How many people will see your content?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Audience activity. There are some audiences that are simply more active online. Programmers, for example, all have blogs and a good twitter following.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Average effect. If you stick the last 5 posts from the host blogger in the effect table, ... are the numbers something you&#39;d want to see on your own content?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Authority. are search engines likely to see the site as an authority? Are your readers? This correlates with their average effect, but it&#39;s not only how much they propagate on the net. How popular a post is is not necessarily related to how authoritative it is. If you have doubts, think LOLcats. They would score high on effect, but low on authority.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finding data about the relative contribution of guest posting is challenging. The ideal situation would be to check your referrer stats, but this only works if you guest-blogged there at least once.  </p>
<p>Taken to a extreme, maintaining your own blog may not be necessary. Some don&#39;t even run an own blog, but build a following by guest posting. One example is @FAKEGRIMLOCK, an anonymous poster than writes in all caps and copies the primitive grammar of a robot T-rex. Why his persona is so effective is material for another post. He started commenting on Fred Wilson&#39;s AVC blog, then got invited to guest post, then moved on to a solo career that includes a book and a blog. But climbing the fame mountain by commenting on other people&#39;s blogs is exceptional.</p>
<h3>How much do you need to blog in-house?</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Enough to make sure a future blogger host sees your content as valuable for his audience. Writing a quality post for another blogger is a great way to network with that blogger. But you must demonstrate that you are a worthwhile person to talk to, and this happens in your own blog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enough so that followers from your guest post find it a good place to stay. Ideally after having seen your guest article people will follow you back to your home base, your site, and read more.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Should you post in quora, g+, LinkedIn, etc?</h3>
<p>Sometimes you have content that just doesn&#39;t fit the &#39;persona&#39; in your blog. I wonder if having posts that are all over the place will damage the type of &#39;highly targeted&#39; blog that would convert the most.</p>
<p>A great way to test this would be to make an experiment. Take two bloggers with similar audiences (say 1000 active readers); Let one of them be laser-focus, posting twice per week only on-topic. Let the other one post more (3 times per week), but rambling a bit. Check the engagement numbers. Which one you think has growh a better, more responsive audience?</p>
<p>While I have no data on this, I suspect the always-on-topic blogger would have a better audience. I&#39;d love to run such an experiment, though.</p>
<p>So what to do with posts that would break the flow on your own blog? Post them on these social media sites. You should try an effect table for your quora, g+, LinkedIn, etc. It might be that one of these channels even outperforms posting on your own blog. LinkedIn seems useful for showing off professional expertise.</p>
<h2>How to get links</h2>
<p>There are many creative ways to build links, but we will stick to the basics for now. Let&#39;s say that: </p>
<ul>
<li>(1) You can guest post, which obviously produces at least a link back to your main site.,</li>
<li>(2) ... and you can use sites that like to link to resources like yours.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Credit: I got this idea from Rob Wailing&#39;s mailing list.)</p>
<h3>Find blogs that take guest posts</h3>
<p>One of the hardest tasks for guest posting is finding blogs that allow guest posts.</p>
<p>One trick is to use Google syntax you can narrow down your list to blogs that accept guest posts.</p>
<p>Here are the two searches you would run:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="haskell"><span class="title">inpostauthor</span>:guest [your market]
<span class="title">inurl</span>:category/guest [your market]</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="haskell"><span class="title">inpostauthor</span>:guest sport clothes
<span class="title">inurl</span>:category/guest sport clothes</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>This query would search for web sites that talk about &quot;sports clothing&quot; and have a links page. Which is what you want to do if you are looking to build links to a sports clothing website </p>
<p>Now, it may be to your advantage to write on your own blog, and get sites to link to you. Or you may want to produce links for a guest post (a bit of a stretch, but this could be a reasonable thing to do).</p>
<p>You should add your guest posts to a table similar to the one in the &#39;What to write&#39; section. Compare stats with posts on your own blog, and with posts by the host. Are they performing better than the host&#39;s average? Tell him that the next time you want to get featured.</p>
<p>While finding the right places to guest post could be outsourced, I&#39;d try to follow the blog for a while. Consider whether the topic that you’re writing about has been covered before - or at least covered recently. Darren Rowse from Pro-Blogger prefers aspiring guest bloggers to contact him <em>before</em> writing the post. Check of they have any recommendations for guest bloggers before commiting time to it.</p>
<p>Are your guest posts working for you? Remember coming back to your guest posts say a month later, and add them to your effect table.</p>
<h3>Find sites that like to link to resources like yours</h3>
<p>You need to find all sites that have a links section, and that are in your ballpark content area. Here&#39;s the search command I would use on Google:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="css"><span class="tag">intitle</span><span class="pseudo">:"sport</span> <span class="tag">clothes</span>" <span class="tag">inurl</span><span class="pseudo">:"links"</span></code></pre>
<p><br>
For each result I found, I&#39;d send a custom email to see if they would be interested in linking to my website.</p>
<p>You can get ~ 10-15% of the websites you email to link back to your website. This is a task that any VA can do for under $10/hr. So even if you get only one backlink per hour, it&#39;s not a bad price, assuming the quality of the sites you email is high. Launch your favorite backlink analysis tool and check out that blog’s links. A higher number of quality links indicates a healthier blog.</p>
<p>For more creative ways of link building, a great place to look is <a href="http://inbound.org">inbound</a>. </p>
<p>These special queries will only get more powerful as google indexes more Semantic Markup. You can filter by date of post, by location, ... and maybe one day by product mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake you can make is not to measure the results. If you apply any of the advice above, and it makes a big splash in your bottom line, I&#39;d love to hear about it.</p>

                    <div class="post-date">Friday, December 21, 2012</div>
                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>AB testing shows multiple variations of your website and measures which
one leads to higher sales. If you have 100 visitors a day, AB testing
can turn 2 purchases into 12 purchases, all with the same amount of
daily traffic. Google Website Optimizer (GWO) comes from a company that
knows AB testing, most shopping carts support it via plugins, and is
free. How could this be a bad choice? The devil is in the details. I’ll
list a few reasons.</p>
<h2>Ambiguous goal</h2>
<p>GWO seemingly aims at two clients, the non-technical marketer, and the
technical person (who happily inserts javascript on their pages). But it
doesn’t serve either of them particularly well.</p>
<h3>The non-technical Marketing expert</h3>
<p>GWO targets the non-technical marketer, since you do not need to write
code to use GWO. Since some small shops do not have technical talent in
house, and big shops have overloaded IT departments, not having to write
code is a big plus. Even in shops large enough to have an IT department
AND resources for AB testing, in our experience IT usually is pretty
isolated from the marketing department. Having the marketers do their
own tests is very empowering. If ease-of-use and simplicity are the
goals, then there are better, simpler tools. Even visual ones. Marketers
who want to run AB testing without code can use Optimizely or Visual
Website Optimizer. Optimizely goal is “to make it as easy as humanly
possible for you to create and run A/B tests on your site. All you need
to do is enter your website URL and point and click on what you want to
change. Absolutely no coding or engineering required. “ Visual Website
Optimizer is an excellent choice too. We just don’t see very many shops
actually using either of them, but we will cover this on another post.</p>
<h3>The programmer</h3>
<p>Actually, the hipster term for a programmer tasked to do this work on a
website is ‘Growth hacker’ :) Turns out that for a ‘Growth hacker’ is at
a loss when using GWO. The ‘data scientist’ in your team won’t be very
happy either. GWO won&#39;t let you play around with the data they collected
for you.You will know that one variation performed better than the
other. You wouldn&#39;t know if one variation resulted in more time spent,
less advert clicks, more user interaction (in terms of comments), or
more purchases. And you won&#39;t know how it affected your overall funnel
behavior. The ‘Growth hacker’ will be the first to point out a bunch of
technical reasons in which it GWO fails short...</p>
<h2>Technical reasons</h2>
<h3>Problems with dynamic sites</h3>
<p>The ‘Growth hacker’ will not be happy with how GWO deals with dynamic
content. Google Website Optimizer does &quot;in-line content replacement&quot; of
tested elements. That&#39;s not a problem on static landing pages, but it&#39;s
a no-go on most dynamic sites. Which happen to be a majority on 2012’s
internet. In GWO, you end up essentially having to rewrite any variant
to be displayable in Javascript. pages where you have AJAX and Flash
elements are possible, but require workarounds.</p>
<h3>Two-url requirement</h3>
<p>Using variation pages causes SEO and site problems when the test ends
unless you manage your server to produce 301 errors. So you&#39;ll either
need to keep the losers alive forever or set up redirects from each of
the losers to the winner every time you end a test. If being a lot of
server admin work was not enough, this has consequences for the test
results. The browsers loads two pages, and then it redirects to one of
the two alternatives. As a consequence, the marginal load for the
redirect to B artificially biases test results. Search engines penalize
duplicate content, which is exactly what you get when your two
variations, in independent URLs, are online. I believe google is smart
enough to detect the doings of its own product, and not penalizing GWO
users. But even without this penalty, putting the same content on two
URLs visible to users encourages them to link to both. Even after the
test declared it as a loser, the second url may need to stay around
forever. In fact, you risk to disappoint the users that bookmarked the
alternative which lost.</p>
<h3>Load time</h3>
<p>Every time you do a test with two alternatives, it will cost you an
extra page load. With shoppers being extremely sensitive to <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahci/2009/121494/tab2/">loading
times</a>, speed is
crucial. Causing an extra page load is just about the worst thing you
can do for page load speed.</p>
<h3>To Google Website Optimizer, all of your visitors are the same</h3>
<p>In the current GWO, you cannot filter which users go into the test. Not
by search terms. Not by geography. Not by demographics.This goes against
the very essence of optimization. Using demographics for targeting
should be trivial, and a big honking feature for any testing software.
In fact, the web seems to start leaving behind demographics and focus on
psychographics. Times cannot be better for targeting. Consumer are
divided according to their lifestyle, personality, values... There are
some spectacular examples out there. Target could <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">predict that a teen
girl was pregnant before her father
did</a>.
With some thought, and a good campaign, one can get incredibly accurate
targeting. Demographics help you understand who buys your product or
service, while psychographics helps you understand why they buy. Another
way to put it is that demographics are things that can be observed from
the outside, such as age and race, while psychographics are internal
attributes or attitudes. Still, GWO will not let you use your
hard-earned targeting results.</p>
<h2>Usability reasons</h2>
<h3>Time it takes to set up a test</h3>
<p>Using GWO, I feel It takes me too many steps to get to results. It
doesn’t feel productive. This is a reason why you often see Google
Website Optimizer only used on static landing pages and other non-core
site areas. As mentioned above, it just doesn’t work very well with
dynamic pages. That is, most contemporary CMS-based sites would have to
be ‘bypassed’ somehow. You&#39;ll need to manually create all of the
different pages you&#39;re going to test. But time is of issue not only for
the servers: the humans doing it in Javascript sacrifices convenience,
to a level that may make you too lazy to actually test things. For
example, deploying an AB test live on one of my sites took two minutes
(using a server-side test framework), but when I run experiments with
GWO it requires 15 minutes at a minimum.</p>
<h3>Dealing with tags</h3>
<p>Google calls them &quot;page sections.&quot; Omniture calls them &quot;mboxes.&quot; They
define sections that you want to affect in your testing. For this
approach to work, you have to wrap tags around every variable area on
every page and/or template. If you make changes later, then you’ll have
to re-tag, re-QA, and push again your code. This is enough work to make
me think twice about doing any testing. I can see how shops, with
limited resources, struggle to do proper testing, or simply postpone it
to the mythical day ‘when we have more resources’. In sum, google
website optimizer’s usability would make
<a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2007-11-16/">Mordac</a> proud.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In our experience, Businesses see the value in A/B testing but they just
aren&#39;t doing it. If you, or anyone on your team, can program, it’s worth
looking at a server-side solution (more on this in another post). A
server-side solution will have several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It leads to faster loading pages, prevent horrible mistakes, and
gives more flexibility to target your visitors, as we saw in
‘technical reasons’</li>
<li>It’s easier to set up tests, as we saw in the ‘usability’ section</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, all data stays in-house. If you ever come up with some better
analytic method, you can run it retrospectively. Google Website
Optimizer is a great product but if you are short on time and don&#39;t want
to muck with your code, look somewhere else. For more reviews, see

                    <h1><a href='/posts/htm5-means-business-for-ecommerce.html'>HTML5 means business for ecommerce</a></h1>
                    <div class="post-date">Thursday, December 20, 2012</div>
                    <div class="post-content">
                        <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
<p>The name &quot;HTML5&quot; is tending to be used by most people at the moment to describe all the exciting new features in web browsers. Not all of these features are actually part of the HTML5 spec - for example, CSS and Javascript have new features which are being referred to under the HTML5 banner.</p>
<p>HTML5 is a very deep topic, and we will dedicate multiple posts to it. But first, what do people refer to when they talk abot HTML5?</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>HTML5 can allow sites to be enhanced with non-proprietary video and video controls. That is, the common technique of using flash for video on the web will become obsolete. The browser themselves support video natively. Interactive text overlays in-video (which is supported) provide interactivity beyond what we expected before. A video was something you watch from beginning to end; no longer the case. Now interactive video better displays merchandise features. </p>
<p>Video reviews would depend on how fast the user’s internet connection is, but with encoding getting better these could become commonplace in the eCommerce market.</p>
<h2>Geolocation</h2>
<p>Geolocation, while initially intimidating in a “Big Brother” sort of way, is an interesting prospect for eCommerce. For example, you could change the content of your landing page depending on where the user is. The default setting in browsers is to ask the user whether he wants to share his location, so you should have sensible defaults for those cases where you do not know it.</p>
<p>Geolocation is more interesting on mobile devices. For example, you can be notified that the product you are looking for is in stock at a nearby store before pressing the “Add to Basket” button. With HTML5 users can list ‘wants’ on their mobile device that produce notifications when they are in the area where they can buy the product.</p>
<p>Another excellent case for geolocation is using a phone’s built-in GPS feature to determine a user’s location (instead of asking for ZIP codes) to enable features like checking for local inventory. This must help lower cart abandonment rates.</p>
<h2>SEO</h2>
<p>This part may not make much sense to non-technical people. However, for those of you who had to scrape html “in the wild”, it will feel like a godsend. Traditionally HTML described the form, not the content of your site. Designers had to do all kinds of tricks to make their code more readable to external bots and to themselves.</p>
<p>Semantic HTML5 tags, such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, etc make it very easy to find the part of the page you need.</p>
<p>These tags provide additional semantic meaning to your page, which is good for SEO. In genral, any automated system that look at your site will benefit from having well-placed tags.
Offline Storage</p>
<p>Websites can now store data offline within the browser itself to speed up functionality or improve usability when internet access is not available. If you think this sounds similar to cookies you’re right. The difference is that this capability is more robust and “databasey” than cookies are. While great for email and other web apps, there’s not much going on here that affects eCommerce. The current spec for HTML5 allows for 50 mb of storage space. This is useful when your client goes offline, but still would like to browse your shop’s contents. Particularly useful on mobile, where one cannot always assume full connectivity. Google already uses it for gmail offline.</p>
<h2>Improved user experience</h2>
<p>Desktop and native mobile apps tend to provide a superior experience compared to webpages.
For example, ‘drag and drop’ is a common pattern on desktop applications. But doing this on a browser was hard before. HTML5 makes it easy to develop a web application where one can drag items and drop them on a shopping cart.
Signs that it’s time to pay attention to HTML5: Effective August 1, 2011, Google’s desktop applications only run in HTML5-enabled browsers. And Techcrunch reports that HTML5 Features can drive up mobile websites’ usage by up to 28%.</p>
<p>In summary, it is time for online shops to start designing their HTML5 strategy. In the next 6-12 months I anticipate that many staple web apps will start feeling much snappier and well-designed. HTML5 will be (part of) the reason.</p>
