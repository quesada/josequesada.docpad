## What is HTML5?

The name "HTML5" is tending to be used by most people at the moment to describe all the exciting new features in web browsers. Not all of these features are actually part of the HTML5 spec - for example, CSS and Javascript have new features which are being referred to under the HTML5 banner.

HTML5 is a very deep topic, and we will dedicate multiple posts to it. But first, what do people refer to when they talk abot HTML5?

##Video

HTML5 can allow sites to be enhanced with non-proprietary video and video controls. That is, the common technique of using flash for video on the web will become obsolete. The browser themselves support video natively. Interactive text overlays in-video (which is supported) provide interactivity beyond what we expected before. A video was something you watch from beginning to end; no longer the case. Now interactive video better displays merchandise features. 

Video reviews would depend on how fast the user’s internet connection is, but with encoding getting better these could become commonplace in the eCommerce market.

## Geolocation

Geolocation, while initially intimidating in a “Big Brother” sort of way, is an interesting prospect for eCommerce. For example, you could change the content of your landing page depending on where the user is. The default setting in browsers is to ask the user whether he wants to share his location, so you should have sensible defaults for those cases where you do not know it.

Geolocation is more interesting on mobile devices. For example, you can be notified that the product you are looking for is in stock at a nearby store before pressing the “Add to Basket” button. With HTML5 users can list ‘wants’ on their mobile device that produce notifications when they are in the area where they can buy the product.

Another excellent case for geolocation is using a phone’s built-in GPS feature to determine a user’s location (instead of asking for ZIP codes) to enable features like checking for local inventory. This must help lower cart abandonment rates.

## SEO

This part may not make much sense to non-technical people. However, for those of you who had to scrape html “in the wild”, it will feel like a godsend. Traditionally HTML described the form, not the content of your site. Designers had to do all kinds of tricks to make their code more readable to external bots and to themselves.

Semantic HTML5 tags, such as `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc make it very easy to find the part of the page you need.

These tags provide additional semantic meaning to your page, which is good for SEO. In genral, any automated system that look at your site will benefit from having well-placed tags.
Offline Storage

Websites can now store data offline within the browser itself to speed up functionality or improve usability when internet access is not available. If you think this sounds similar to cookies you’re right. The difference is that this capability is more robust and “databasey” than cookies are. While great for email and other web apps, there’s not much going on here that affects eCommerce. The current spec for HTML5 allows for 50 mb of storage space. This is useful when your client goes offline, but still would like to browse your shop’s contents. Particularly useful on mobile, where one cannot always assume full connectivity. Google already uses it for gmail offline.

## Improved user experience

Desktop and native mobile apps tend to provide a superior experience compared to webpages.
For example, ‘drag and drop’ is a common pattern on desktop applications. But doing this on a browser was hard before. HTML5 makes it easy to develop a web application where one can drag items and drop them on a shopping cart.
Signs that it’s time to pay attention to HTML5: Effective August 1, 2011, Google’s desktop applications only run in HTML5-enabled browsers. And Techcrunch reports that HTML5 Features can drive up mobile websites’ usage by up to 28%.

In summary, it is time for online shops to start designing their HTML5 strategy. In the next 6-12 months I anticipate that many staple web apps will start feeling much snappier and well-designed. HTML5 will be (part of) the reason.
