# Conversion
But as conversion goes, the giant is clearly Amazon. [Amazon generates 47
times as much revenue per unique visitor as Facebook](http://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/online-business-revenue-models/amazon-case-study/). 

Why is this important?
Amazon expertly leverages online behavior to optimize conversions. Its
suggestive shopping engine offers an excellent example of tying visitor actions
into personalized offers. Amazon focuses on visitor intent and site optimization
to sell more.
Amazon’s obsessive focus on measuring every single visitor action led to online
product revenues of USD 42 billion in 2011, [21 percent of online retail sales
in the country]( http://www.reportlinker.com/p0925320-summary/Consumer-Attitudes-and-Online-Retail-Dynamics-in-the-US.html
). Estimates on Amazon’s conversion rates range from 9.8 to 18
percent. Whatever the actual number is, it's far higher than the industry average.
Amazon's behavioral targeting strategy is brilliant. 

Behavioral Targeting is one of the most efficient, proactive strategies that an online store can undertake.
